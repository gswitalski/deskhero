## 3. Authentication and Authorization
- The API uses JWT token-based authentication. Tokens are issued upon successful login and expire after 24 hours.
- Protected endpoints (reservation creation, cancellation, and desk management) require a valid JWT token in the `Authorization` header (format: `Bearer <token>`).
- Role-based access control:
  - **User**: Can create, view, and cancel their own reservations.
  - **Admin**: Has additional privileges for managing desks and cancelling any reservation.
- Integration with Spring Security and usage of the `authorities` table ensures that only authorized users can perform sensitive operations.

## 4. Validation and Business Logic
- **Validation**:
  - **Users**: Ensure that the username (email) is unique and that all required fields are provided.
  - **Desks**: The combination of `roomName` and `deskNumber` must be unique.
  - **Reservations**:
    - Reservation date must be provided and valid.
    - A desk can only be reserved once per day (enforced by a unique constraint on `desk_id` and `reservation_date`).
- **Business Logic**:
  - **Reservation Creation**: Upon creating a reservation, check for availability and enforce the unique constraint to prevent duplicate bookings.
  - **Reservation Cancellation**: Update the reservation status to "cancelled" instead of deleting the record, preserving booking history.
  - **Listing Reservations**: Reservations can be filtered by status and date range to differentiate between upcoming and past bookings.
  - **Error Handling**: Clear error messages and appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 409) are returned for invalid operations.
- **Performance Considerations**:
  - Endpoints that return lists (e.g., reservations, desks) should support pagination, filtering, and sorting.
  - Indexes on database columns (such as `username`, `desk_id`, `reservation_date`) are leveraged to optimize query performance.
