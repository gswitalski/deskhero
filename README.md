## Getting Started Locally
To run DeskHero on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Frontend Setup:
1. Ensure you have Node.js and npm installed.
2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```
4. Start the Angular development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
   The application will be available at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).

### Backend Setup:
1. Ensure you have Java (JDK 21 or later) and Gradle installed.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
3. Build and run the backend application using Gradle:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
   The backend service will start on the default port (typically 8080). Adjust the configuration as needed.

## Available Scripts
