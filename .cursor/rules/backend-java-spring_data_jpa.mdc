### Guidelines for JAVA

#### SPRING_DATA_JPA

- Define repositories as interfaces extending `JpaRepository` or `CrudRepository`
- Never expose JPA entities in API responses â€“ always map them to DTOs
- Use `@Transactional` at the service layer for state-changing methods, and keep transactions as short as possible
- Use `@Transactional(readOnly = true)` for read-only operations
- Use `@EntityGraph` or fetch joins to avoid the N+1 select problem
- Use `@Query` for complex queries
- Use projections (DTOs) in multi-join queries with `@Query`
- Use Specifications for dynamic filtering
- Use pagination when working with large datasets
- Use `@Version` for optimistic locking in concurrent updates
- Avoid `CascadeType.REMOVE` on large entity relationships
- Use HikariCP for efficient connection pooling
